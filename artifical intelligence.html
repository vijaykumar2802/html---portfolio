        I completed an 8-week intensive Artificial Intelligence course designed to build foundational and practical skills in AI and Machine Learning. 
        The curriculum covered core topics including Python for AI, supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning fundamentals, and hands-on model development using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Keras.
