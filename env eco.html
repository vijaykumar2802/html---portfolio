        I completed the NPTEL course on Introduction to Environmental Economics, which explored the intersection of economic theory and environmental policy. 
        The course provided a strong foundation in understanding how economic tools can be used to address environmental challenges, evaluate the costs and benefits of environmental actions, and develop sustainable solutions.
